# Zandor IV

#### Summary
In this installment of the Zandor saga we find our ship at a refueling station on a remote moon. In order to complete the next leg of its mission a precise amount of fuel is required. If too much is taken on it will likely explode, but too little won't be enough to make it to the next refueling station. It's up to you to use the fuel capacities of the various crystals found on this world to fill the tank to its exact capacity. Good luck!

#### How to Play
